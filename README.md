## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

The design was executed using some smart css tricks like centering a div using flexbox as well as making the component responsive to all devices.

## Optimizations

With more time I probably could have added a bounce animation or a fade-in animation to make it more lively.

## Lessons Learned:

One neat trick I found when building this project is that you could also use grid to center the component and it would only need 2 lines or so to get the job done.
